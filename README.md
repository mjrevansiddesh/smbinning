# smbinning

I used this package extensively while working at a financial institution. For areas like credit risk modeling, designing a scorecard is very beneficial because the decision to grant a loan or not is automated.

The main purpose of this package is to categorize a numeric variable into bins mapped to a binary target variable for its 
ulterior usage in scoring modeling. This functionality reduces dramatically the time consuming process of finding the optimal
cut points for a given numeric variable, quickly calculates the Information Value, either for one variable at the time or all 
at once in one line of code; and also outputs 'SQL' codes, tables, and plots used throughout the development stage.

smbinning.R -> The applications of this package is explained for the 'chilean credit' dataset.
